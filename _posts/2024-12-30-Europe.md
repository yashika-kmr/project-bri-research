As of 2024, the BRI has entered a critical phase in Europe: 
•	Italy's Exit: Italy officially left the BRI at the end of 2023, dealing a significant blow to China's initiative
•	Two-Speed Approach: Europe now demonstrates a divided approach, with Western European countries moving away from physical infrastructure projects, while Eastern European nations continue to seek Chinese investments

Major projects in Europe: 

1. The Piraeus Port (Greece)
One of the most high-profile BRI projects in Europe is the expansion of the Piraeus Port in Greece, located near Athens. In 2008, China’s state-owned company, COSCO Shipping, began investing in the port, which has since become a critical link between Europe and China. Over the years, China has poured significant resources into modernizing Piraeus, transforming it into one of the busiest ports in Europe.
The port's strategic location along major shipping routes makes it a key player in facilitating trade between China and Europe. It acts as a transshipment hub, where goods are transferred between ships, helping to streamline trade across the Mediterranean. By 2020, COSCO had increased its stake in the port, gaining a controlling share, and further investment was made to upgrade its facilities. As a result, Greece has seen significant economic benefits, including job creation and increased revenue from port activities.
However, the project has also raised concerns about China's growing influence in Greece, with critics arguing that the country’s economic dependency on Chinese investments could compromise its political independence, particularly in the context of European Union relations.

2. The Hungary-Serbia Railway
The railway, designed to link the Hungarian capital, Budapest, with the Serbian capital, Belgrade, is being built with significant Chinese financial support. The project, estimated at €2.89 billion, is expected to reduce travel time between the two cities from 8 hours to just 3.5 hours.
This railway is part of China’s broader vision to strengthen its influence in Central and Eastern Europe. By improving transportation links, China hopes to create a more efficient trade corridor between China and the European Union, allowing goods to move more quickly and reliably between the two regions. Once completed, this railway is expected to not only benefit Serbia and Hungary but also improve access for other European countries.

3. The Belgrade Waterfront Project (Serbia)
The Belgrade Waterfront, a large-scale urban development project in Serbia, is another major BRI initiative that has brought significant Chinese investment into Europe. Launched in 2014, the project aims to transform the Belgrade waterfront area by constructing modern residential, commercial, and retail spaces, as well as hotels and leisure facilities. The project is being financed by Chinese companies, particularly the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), and is expected to boost Serbia’s tourism industry and urban economy.
This project is seen as a symbol of China’s growing influence in Serbia and the Balkans. By investing in such high-profile infrastructure, China not only contributes to Serbia’s economic development but also secures its strategic ties to the region. However, like other BRI projects, there are concerns about the environmental impact of such large-scale developments and the level of debt Serbia is taking on to fund the project.

4. The Ljubljana-Koper Railway (Slovenia)
The Slovenian section of the BRI, primarily focused on modernizing the railway system, includes a major project to upgrade the Ljubljana-Koper railway. This project is designed to enhance the connectivity between Slovenia’s capital, Ljubljana, and its port city, Koper, which is the country’s only major seaport. China has expressed interest in helping finance and develop this project, which aims to increase the capacity and efficiency of the rail system.
By improving the transportation network, Slovenia hopes to enhance its trade routes and become a key link between Central Europe and the Mediterranean. The project will also make it easier for goods to flow between China and European markets, contributing to regional economic growth. While Slovenia stands to benefit from improved infrastructure, the involvement of Chinese companies raises questions about the long-term implications of China’s investments in the country.

5. The Vardar Highway (North Macedonia)
North Macedonia is another European country where the Belt and Road Initiative is making a noticeable impact. The Vardar Highway, a critical infrastructure project linking the capital, Skopje, to Greece, is being funded and constructed with Chinese support. This highway is part of a broader effort to improve transportation networks in the Balkans and connect countries in the region more efficiently with Europe and Asia.
Once completed, the Vardar Highway will help facilitate the flow of goods and people, boosting trade and tourism. The project also aligns with China’s broader goal of enhancing connectivity across the region, creating new economic opportunities for both China and North Macedonia. However, concerns have been raised about the financial sustainability of the project, as well as the potential for rising debt in a small economy like North Macedonia’s.
