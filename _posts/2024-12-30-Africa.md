1. The Mombasa-Nairobi Railway (Kenya)
One of the most prominent BRI projects in Africa is the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway in Kenya. Funded by Chinese loans and built by Chinese companies, this modern railway connects Kenya’s largest port, Mombasa, with its capital, Nairobi. The railway has greatly reduced transportation costs and travel time, making it easier to move goods between the port and the interior of the country.
While the project has boosted Kenya’s economy, it has also raised concerns about the country’s growing debt to China. Kenya has struggled to repay the loans for the railway, leading to fears that it may face financial difficulties in the long term. However, the project has created thousands of jobs and is seen as a critical part of Kenya’s economic growth strategy.

2. The Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway (Ethiopia)
In East Africa, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, another major BRI project, connects Ethiopia’s capital with the port of Djibouti. This railway provides Ethiopia with direct access to the sea, reducing its reliance on neighboring countries for trade routes. The project is expected to lower transportation costs and facilitate economic growth in Ethiopia, which is one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa.
The railway is also a crucial link in China’s efforts to expand trade routes across Africa, enhancing its strategic position on the continent. While the project has been praised for improving regional trade and connectivity, there are concerns about the potential impact of the debt burden on Ethiopia, particularly as the country’s economy continues to face challenges.

3. The Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET)
The Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) is a massive infrastructure project aimed at linking Kenya’s Lamu port with landlocked South Sudan and Ethiopia. The project involves the construction of a port, railways, highways, and airports, and is expected to boost trade and development in East Africa.
Funded by China and other international partners, the LAPSSET project will create new trade routes and help facilitate the movement of goods across the region. It is expected to promote regional integration and economic growth, particularly for South Sudan and Ethiopia, which rely heavily on trade through neighboring countries. However, like other BRI projects, there are concerns about the financial sustainability of the project and the growing debt that Kenya and its neighbors are taking on.

4. The Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (Djibouti)
Djibouti, a small but strategically located country on the Horn of Africa, has become a focal point of Chinese investment under the BRI. The Djibouti International Free Trade Zone is a major project designed to boost trade and investment in the region. With China’s help, Djibouti is developing a logistics hub that will facilitate the movement of goods between Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.
This project is part of China’s broader strategy to strengthen its economic and political influence in the Horn of Africa. The free trade zone is expected to create thousands of jobs and attract significant foreign investment, transforming Djibouti into a key player in global trade. However, concerns about Djibouti’s increasing dependence on Chinese loans and its potential long-term debt burden remain.

5. The Congo River Basin Infrastructure Projects (Democratic Republic of the Congo)
In Central Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been a beneficiary of several BRI-funded infrastructure projects, particularly in the Congo River Basin. These projects include the construction of roads, bridges, and hydroelectric plants designed to improve connectivity and promote economic development in one of Africa’s poorest countries.
The DRC’s reliance on Chinese investments has helped to improve its infrastructure and stimulate growth. However, the country faces significant challenges in managing its debt and ensuring that these projects translate into long-term economic benefits. Critics argue that the DRC’s growing debt to China could undermine its sovereignty and hinder its economic future.
