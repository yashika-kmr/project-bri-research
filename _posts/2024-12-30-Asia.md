List of major projects: 

1. China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) connects China’s Xinjiang province to Pakistan’s Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea. With an estimated investment of over $60 billion, the CPEC includes highways, railways, power plants, and other key infrastructure.
This corridor is expected to reduce transportation time between China and the Middle East by 10-20 days, offering China easy and efficient access to international markets through the port of Gwadar. For Pakistan, it promises to boost economic growth by continuing to provide numerous job opportunities. As of now, this project has generated 236,000 jobs in Pakistan.

2. The Colombo Port City (Sri Lanka)
Sri Lanka's Colombo Port City involves a $1.4 billion investment. The project aims to transform the Colombo waterfront into a sprawling financial district with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. It is designed to attract foreign investment and turn Colombo into a regional business hub.
While the project promises significant economic benefits, including job creation and increased revenue from tourism and business, concerns have been raised about the project's environmental impact such as water pollution, was-dumping, acidification, etc. Additionally, Sri Lanka’s growing debt to China has been a major economic concern. In 2017, Sri Lanka had to lease the port for 99 years to a Chinese company after struggling to repay loans – an indication of debt dependency.

3. The Kyaukphyu Port (Myanmar)
The Kyaukphyu Port is located on the Bay of Bengal. The port is being developed with Chinese investments to become a key hub for trade between China and the Indian Ocean. The project includes the construction of a deep-sea port, industrial parks, high-end housing, all with connecting highways. This port will allow China to bypass the Strait of Malacca, ensuring a more secure and direct route for its oil and gas imports.
The port development is seen as strategically important for both China and Myanmar, as it will strengthen China’s trade access to the Indian Ocean. This project is being used as a key asset against the influence of the United States globally as the strait of Malacca is controlled by them.

4. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway (Indonesia)
This project, funded by Chinese loans, will connect the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, with the city of Bandung, reducing travel time from over 3 hours to just 40 minutes. The railway is expected to improve transportation efficiency and stimulate economic growth by making it easier to move people and goods between these major cities.
The project has faced delays and budget overruns, but it represents China’s push to build modern infrastructure across Southeast Asia, boosting trade and connectivity in the region. For Indonesia, the railway promises to reduce congestion, increase tourism, and create thousands of jobs.

5. The Belt and Road Initiative in Central Asia
Central Asia is another region where the BRI has had a transformative impact, particularly through the development of roads and railways. Key projects include the construction of a railway line connecting Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and China, as well as significant road improvements across the region.
These projects are helping to increase trade between Central Asia and China, providing landlocked countries like Kazakhstan with better access to global markets. By improving infrastructure, the BRI is facilitating the growth of industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and mining, driving economic development in the region. However, there are concerns about the long-term sustainability of these projects and the rising debt burden on these countries. it deepens economic disparities and geopolitical divides? The answer lies in how participating countries navigate the fine line between partnership and dependence.
