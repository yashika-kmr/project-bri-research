How it all started: 

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is a signature project of President Xi Jinping's foreign policy. It has two main parts: the Silk Road Economic Belt, which will connect China with Europe through Central Asia, and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which will connect China with Southeast [Asia](_posts/2024-12-30-Asia.md), Africa, and Europe by sea. Its first big successes included the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a $62 billion investment into roads, railways, and the Gwadar Port, which afforded China strategic access to the Arabian Sea. In Africa, it was building the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway, a key trade route serving Ethiopia's landlocked economy. It soon expanded its scope to more than 140 countries, financing several projects, such as the Budapest-Belgrade railway in Europe and the Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka.
